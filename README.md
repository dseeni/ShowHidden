# ShowHidden
Simple Add-in for Body/Component Display

## Usage:
First see [How to install sample Add-Ins and Scripts](https://rawgit.com/AutodeskFusion360/AutodeskFusion360.github.io/master/Installation.html)

This addin allows you to adjust the display of bodies and components in the graphics window.

First you can show all components or bodies.  

Alternatively, you can "Show Hidden" which will make all hidden bodies/compnents displayed and all shown entities become hidden.  Essentially inveting the hide/show state of the display.

Here is a quick description of the useful workflow:
  * In a large assembly you may have some hidden bodies that are are to find in the tree that you want to show.
  * Run the addin
  * Select: Inspect/Show Hidden
  * Select: Show Hiddden and Bodies
  * Now all the previously hidden bodies will be displayed.
  * #Hide the body you wanted to show originally
  * Select: Inspect/Show Hidden
  * Select: Show Hiddden and Bodies
  * You now have the previous state with the desired bodies shown
